We are applying for **Reusable** and **Available** badges.

### Reusable
- We provide a docker image at `unsatx/gentree_docker:icse21` containing all the development and evaluation tools.
- We provide an instruction to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
- The tool is highly modular, which makes it easy to modify/extend the core algorithm.

### Available
- The GenTree source code is available at https://github.com/unsat/gentree
- The Docker build script is available at https://github.com/unsat/gentree_docker/tree/master/icse21
- Source code snapshot is available at 10.5281/zenodo.4434917 (https://zenodo.org/record/4434917).
