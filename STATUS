We are applying for Reusable and Available badges.

1) Reusable:
- We provide a docker image at `unsatx/gentree_docker:icse21` containing all the development and evaluation tools.
- We provide an instruction to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
- The tool is well-documented and highly modular, which makes it easy to modify/extend the core algoritm.

2) Available:
- The source code is available at https://github.com/unsat/gentree
- The Docker build script is available at https://github.com/unsat/gentree_docker/tree/master/icse21
- The Docker image is available at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/unsatx/gentree_docker/ or https://github.com/unsat/gentree_docker/releases/tag/icse21
